# 3D visualizer/Editor for three.js

This app is an editor for three js where user can create and edit 3d scene and export it to use in a three js enviroment of export as a standalone 3d file.
User can create complete scene using Gui tools without writing any code. The application is my personal project and is under heavy development. Please do not use it as many things can give errors and cause crashes. Not all features are present at the moment.

## Expected Features

All features if a 3D editing app like blender and maya but on a small scale majorly focused towards three js deveopers.

## Current Features

### A 3d environment similar to blender to edit and create 3d objects
### Option to load external 3d models
   #### currently supported file formats : Gltf, glb, fbx, obj
### option to add inbuilt primitive models
   #### currently have 12 different primitives
### import a scene that is in Three js scene json format
### export the current scene as Three js scene json format
### select ojects in the scene:
   #### Multi-select : select complete group
   #### Single-select : select single meshes from groups - can select meshes from objects imported from ecternal files
 
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
